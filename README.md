## Description
The purpose of the weather application is to serve as a weather app. The user would enter a valid city name inside an input box, and click the search button. With the use of server-side apis, the weather forecast would be displayed to the right of the search side area. On the weather forecast side, the upper portion displayed the current day forecast (City name, today's date, icon of weather forecast, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and uv index). In the UV index, the color of the background would change on whether it is favorable(green), moderate(orange), and severe(red). If the user were to enter an invalid city name, an error message would be displayed where the current day forcast would be. On a valid city name, under the current day forecast, a 5 day forecast section will be seen. On each of the five day, the date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity is displayed.

After the user searches for a city's weather forecast, the city name is stored into local storage, valid or not. Then links buttons are created from local storage, that if they are pressed, that weather forecast is displayed.

Incase the user would like the clear search history, there is a semi-hidden clear search history button on the left side of the navbar. It would clear local storage and reload page, making the search history button list to being cleared, as if the weather app would appear to be loaded for the first time.
